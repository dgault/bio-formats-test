LOCI Software Release Procedure
-------------------------------

This document describes the tests we perform preceding each official release
of the LOCI Tools library.

1) Run the automated TestNG test suite in loci/tests/testng.
  - Use bftest script in this directory, which calls the ant "test-all" target.

2) Manual tests in loci/tests:
  - ImageTester
  - ZipTester

ImageJ tests:

3) Run the ImageJ macros in the loci/tests/macros folder.
  - opens files in as many supported file formats as possible
  - opens files with different combinations of options selected
  - tests Bio-Formats macro extensions
  - tests Data Browser, Image5D integration, View5D integration...
  - tests native library functionality
  - what else can we test in a semi-automated way using a macro?

4) Test Bio-Formats Importer plugin with older versions of ImageJ.
  - Rename ijxxx.jar to ij.jar for versions:
    123y, 129w, 133u, 134s, 135s, 136b, 137v, 138x, 139u

5) Check the Bio-Formats configuration dialog in ImageJ.
  - Verify that no exceptions are produced in the Log tab.

Other tests:

(may turn these into automated or manual tests -- see #1 & #2 above)

6) Use bfconvert to convert a multi-series Leica LIF to OME-TIFF, and verify
   that all metadata was preserved, including OriginalMetadata elements.

7) Use omeul to upload a multi-series OME-TIFF to the OME server, then
   download in ImageJ using the "Download from OME" plugin.

8) Use "Upload to OME" plugin in ImageJ to upload a multi-series OME-TIFF to
   the OMERO server, then download using VisBio.

Rotate test procedure between Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
